# üìö Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains organized and topic-wise implementations of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in C++ (and/or other supported languages). It is intended to serve as a learning resource and a reference for competitive programming, interviews, and academic study.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

Each folder contains multiple problem solutions or implementations related to that specific DSA topic:

| Folder        | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Array`       | Basic array manipulation problems, including prefix/suffix, etc. |
| `Graph`       | Graph representations, BFS, DFS, shortest paths, cycle detection, and more. |
| `HashSet`     | Simple hashing techniques and their usecases. |
| `Linked List` | Singly/Doubly linked list problems, reverse, merge, detect loop, etc. |
| `Queue`       | Standard queue problems, circular queue, deque, and priority queues. |
| `Sorting`     | Sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, and their use in problems. |
| `Stack`       | Stack implementation and use cases: Next Greater Element, infix/postfix evaluation, etc. |
| `Tree`        | Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Tree traversals, and tree-based problems. |
